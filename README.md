# CSS Stamina Wheel

CSS Stamina Wheel is inspired by Zelda's Breath of the Wild.

It's a pure CSS implementation using CSS Animations, `var`, `calc` and round corners.
The little JS it has is only meant for switching between 2D and 3D versions and also to prevent copy pasting of code.

The code also provides options (they're hidden though) to change the color, size and speed of the wheel.
